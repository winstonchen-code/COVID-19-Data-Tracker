# COVID-19 Data Tracker App 

## INSPIRATION

After 12 months where the world has faced a tsunami of suffering, the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines represents some light at the end of the tunnel. However, there has still been a surge in COVID-19 recently with people taking less precautions to protect themselves from the virus. As a result, I wanted to create an easy to use application that can keep people aware of the number of cases in specific areas. This will keep the public aware of the ongoing pandemic and not lose sight of protecting the people around them.

## WHAT IT DOES

COVID-19 Data Tracker is an online app designed to give you the latest statistics on COVID-19 based on your location.

## WHAT'S NEXT

I plan to build out more features of the application so that individuals can access articles and videos that discusses COVID-19. After adding these features, I want to promote the platform to users seeking more info on COVID-19, so that it can benefit individuals across the globe, and reduce the surge in cases.
