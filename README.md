# Covid-19 Data Tracker App 

## INSPIRATION

An app that displays the most up-to-date Covid-19 statistics.

## WHAT IT DOES

Covid-19 Data Tracker is an online app that helps people of all ages to relax by timed breathing training. Anyone can access it through a simple click and start meditating.

## WHAT'S NEXT

I plan to build out more features of the application so that individuals can access articles and videos that discusses stress management. Additionally, I want to add music either on the platform or links so that individuals can easily change the background music to free themselves from distraction and to increase relaxation. After adding these features, I want to promote the platform to users seeking an app to reduce stress, so that it can benefit individuals across the globe.
